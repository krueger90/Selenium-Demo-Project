# Selenium-Demo-Project

## Intro

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my abilities in framework setup and test writing and implementation using Selenium with Java and TestNG. The tests will focus on automating various scenarios on a dummy SUT (a third party website specially created for this purpose).

## Pre-requirements

I used versions `v21.0.1` and `3.9.5` of Java and Maven respectively. You can use the same, later or a minimum version of Java 11, required by TestNG.

## Installation

Run `mvn install`.

## Tests

Run `mvn test`
